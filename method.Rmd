# Single cell RNA-seq

## Single cell transcriptome of 3005 cortical cells

** Cell types in the mouse cortex and hippocampus revealed by single-cell RNA-seq **    
* Sten Linnarsson @ Karolinska Institute, Sweden *   

- Individual RNA molecules were counted using unique molecular identifiers
- Molecularly distinct classes of cells were identified by clustering (9 major classes and 47 subclasses)
- Cell type-specific markers were identified: S1 pyramidal cells (Tbr1), oligodendrocytes (Hapln2), Hippocampal pyramidal neurons (Spink8), interneuron (Pnoc)

## The raw data

## Discussion

** How to use this data? **

- Markers
- Correlation
- Hypergeometric test
