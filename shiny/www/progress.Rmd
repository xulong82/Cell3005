## Integrate single cell RNA-seq data to infer cell compositions in tissue-wise gene expression measurements

***

#### 1. The raw data: single cell transcriptome of 3005 cortical cells

- Individual RNA molecules were counted using unique molecular identifiers
- Molecularly distinct classes of cells were identified by clustering (9 major classes and 47 subclasses)
- Reference: Cell types in the mouse cortex and hippocampus revealed by single-cell RNA-seq. *Science. 2015. Sten Linnarsson*  

***

#### 2. We used a generalized linear model to decompose the 47 cell type's gene expression profiles

- $\mu = \beta_{astrocyte} * astrocyte + \beta_{neuron} * neuron + ... + \beta_{basal} * basal$  
- $y \sim NB(\mu, \rho)$

***

#### 3. Marker genesets for the 47 cell types were constructed

- To assign a gene as a marker of astrocyte, 95% credible interval of the $\beta_{astrocyte}$ from GLM needs to be 3+
- Repeate for neuron, oligodendrocytes, et al.
- Remove genes that appear in all cell types

***

#### 4. Infer a particular geneset's cell origin by testing its enrichment of the marker genes

- Hypergeometric test with the input genesets and 47 marker genesets.

***

#### 5. Correlate SCR and Howell's RNA-seq from mice cortex with PMCA

- Robyn's method: PMCA
